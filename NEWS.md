# misha 5.3.4

* Added `dataframe` and `names` parameters to `gdist` function that return a data frame instead of an N-dimensional vector.

# misha 5.3.3

* Allow a vector of sizes in `gintervals.normalize`.
* **BREAKING**: `gintervals.normalize` now returns +1bp for intervals with odd sizes:
  - Old: expansion = size/2; [center-expansion, center+expansion] (loses 1bp for odd sizes)
  - New: new_start = center - (size/2); new_end = new_start + size (exact size always)
* Added `interval_relative` parameter to `giterator.intervals()` for interval-aligned bin iteration.

# misha 5.3.2

* Fixed GCC-ASAN / LTO compilation warnings. 

# misha 5.3.1

* Fixed a CRAN check warning about long lines in documentation.

# misha 5.3.0

* **Multi-contig support**: Added support for genomes with many contigs (100+) through new indexed database format
  - New indexed format (default): Uses unified `genome.seq` + `genome.idx` files instead of per-chromosome files
  - Dramatically reduces file descriptor usage for genomes with many contigs
  - Provides 4-14% performance improvement for large-scale analyses
  - Removes the requirement for "chr" prefix in chromosome names.
  - **Backward compatible**: Legacy per-chromosome format fully supported
  - Automatic format detection - no user action required
  - New functions: `gdb.info()`, `gdb.convert_to_indexed()`, `gtrack.convert_to_indexed()`, `gintervals.convert_to_indexed()`, `gintervals.2d.convert_to_indexed()`
  - Set `options(gmulticontig.indexed_format = FALSE)` to create databases in legacy format for compatibility with older misha versions
  - See `vignette("Database-Formats")` for more details.
* **Auto-configuration**: Package now automatically configures itself based on system resources
  - `gmax.processes` automatically set to 70% of available CPU cores
  - `gmax.data.size` coordinated with process limits to ensure total memory usage <= 70% of RAM (capped at 10GB per process)
  - Formula: `gmax.data.size = min((RAM * 0.7) / gmax.processes, 10GB)` ensures safe memory usage across all parallel processes
  - Dynamic auto-disable threshold: small datasets automatically use single-threaded mode to avoid fork overhead
  - Threshold scales with system: `gmax.processes * 1000 records` (e.g., 2K on laptops, 89K on 128-core servers)
  - Manual override still supported via `options()`
  - See "Auto-Configuration" section in `vignette("Manual")` for details
* Added in-memory value-based virtual tracks (`gvtrack.create` with `src` parameter). These tracks behave exactly like regular sparse tracks, but are stored in memory and can be used in track expressions.
* Added `sshift`, `eshift` and `filter` parameters to `gvtrack.create`.
* Added `gintervals.path()` and `gtrack.path()` functions that return the actual file system paths for interval sets and tracks. 
* Added `masked.count` and `masked.frac` virtual track functions that count and fraction masked base pairs (lowercase letters) in the current iterator interval.
* Added `distance.edge` virtual track function that computes edge-to-edge distance from the iterator interval to the closest source interval, using the same calculation as `gintervals.neighbors`. 

# misha 5.2.2

* Fix: `gtrack.liftover` did not fill chromosomes missing the chain with NA values. This caused errors when trying to access the tracks afterwards.

# misha 5.2.1

* Added `gintervals.as_chain` function that converts a data frame to a chain object.
* Added value column aggregation support to `gintervals.liftover` via `value_col` and `multi_target_agg` parameters.

# misha 5.2.0

* Added `src_overlap_policy` and `tgt_overlap_policy` parameters to `gintervals.liftover`, `gintervals.load_chain`, and `gtrack.liftover` functions.
* Added target aggregation in `gtrack.liftover` via `multi_target_agg` parameter.
* `gintervals.load_chain` now returns valid misha intervals instead of a chain object.
* Added score-based liftover functionality matching UCSC liftOver behavior:
  - `gintervals.load_chain` now includes `score` and `chain_id` columns for all loaded chains
  - New `min_score` parameter in `gintervals.load_chain`, `gintervals.liftover`, and `gtrack.liftover` filters out low-quality chains
  - New `tgt_overlap_policy = "auto_score"` (or `"auto"`) selects the best chain mapping based on alignment score (highest score → longest span → lowest chain_id)
  - New `include_metadata` parameter in `gintervals.liftover` optionally returns score and chain_id for each mapping
  **BREAKING**: "auto" is now an alias for "auto_score". For the old behavior, use `tgt_overlap_policy = "auto_first"`.
* Added `canonic` parameter to `gintervals.liftover` (default `FALSE`) to merge adjacent target intervals resulting from the same source interval and chain.
* Added three clustering strategies for liftover target overlap policies:
  - `tgt_overlap_policy = "best_cluster_union"` (default, aliased as `"best_source_cluster"`): Uses source union coverage
  - `tgt_overlap_policy = "best_cluster_sum"`: Uses sum of target lengths
  - `tgt_overlap_policy = "best_cluster_max"`: Uses longest single member

# misha 5.1.4

* Added new virtual track functions:
  - `max.pos.abs`, `max.pos.relative`, `min.pos.abs`, `min.pos.relative`: Returns the position of the maximum/minimum value in the iterator interval
  - `exists`: Returns 1 if any value exists (or specific vals if provided), 0 otherwise
  - `size`: Returns the number of non-NaN values in the iterator interval
  - `sample`: Returns a uniformly sampled source value from the iterator interval
  - `sample.pos.abs` and `sample.pos.relative`: Returns the position of a uniformly sampled value
  - `first` and `last`: Returns the first/last value in the iterator interval
  - `first.pos.abs`, `first.pos.relative`, `last.pos.abs`, `last.pos.relative`: Returns the position of the first/last value

# misha 5.1.3

* Fixed a bug in `gintervals.neighbors` when using `mindist=0, maxdist=0`: the function would miss zero-distance (touching) intervals when using `mindist=0, maxdist=0`.
* Fixed error reporting in multitasking mode: when a child process ends unexpectedly, the error message is now correctly reported to the parent process.
* Fixed `pwm.count` with spatial sliding windows double-counting bidirectional hits (forward + reverse) at the same genomic position; the sliding path now matches the baseline per-position union semantics.

# misha 5.1.2

* **BREAKING**: `gintervals.load_chain` now returns a data frame with 8 columns instead of 7. Columns are: `chrom`, `start`, `end`, `strand`, `chromsrc`, `startsrc`, `endsrc`, `strandsrc`.
* Added `src_overlap_policy` and `tgt_overlap_policy` parameters to `gintervals.load_chain`, `gtrack.liftover` and `gintervals.liftover` functions.
* Added `neighbor.count` virtual track.
* Added `gintervals.mark_overlaps` function that marks overlapping intervals with a group ID.

# misha 5.1.1

* Allow data frames as input in `pssm` parameter of `gvtrack.create` and `gseq.pwm` functions.
* Implemented parallelism in `gseq.pwm` and added `neutral_chars_policy` parameter.
* Implemented sliding window optimization for PWM scoring modes (`pwm`, `pwm.max` and `pwm.count`) for dense iterators when spatial weighting is disabled, providing significant performance improvements for consecutive genomic intervals.
* **BREAKING**: `pwm.count(bidirect=TRUE)` now counts **per-position union** of strands (via log-sum-exp), aligning with `pwm`/`pwm.max`. Each position contributes at most 1 to the count. To reproduce the old per-strand-sum behavior, add the two strand-specific counts: `pwm.count(bidirect=FALSE, strand=1) + pwm.count(bidirect=FALSE, strand=-1)`.

# misha 5.1.0

* Added `gseq.pwm` and `gseq.kmer` functions that compute pwm and kmer scores on sequences without the need for a genome database.
* Added `gseq.rev` and `gseq.comp` functions that reverse and complement DNA sequences without the need for a genome database.
* Added `gseq.revcomp` alias for `grevcomp` function.
* Added `gintervals.random` function that generates random genome intervals.

  - `gintervals.neighbors.downstream()` - Find downstream neighbors relative to query strand  
  - `gintervals.neighbors.directional()` - Find both upstream and downstream neighbors
* Added `use_intervals1_strand` parameter to `gintervals.neighbors()` to use query intervals' strand for distance directionality.
* Added `warn.ignored.strand` parameter to `gintervals.neighbors()` to control warnings when query strand is ignored.
* Fixed a bug in `gintervals.neighbors`: a stack imbalance in the C++ code in very rare cases of 2D intervals.
* Fixed errors in regression tests of `gintervals.neighbors` due to unbalanced `rprotect` calls.

# misha 4.3.12

* Added `gintervals.normalize` and `gintervals.annotate` functions.
* Fixed errors in `m1-asan` build.

* Added `gtrack.create_dirs` function.
* Fixed a bug in `gcluster.run`.
* Updated documentation of `gintervals.neighbors`.

# misha 4.2.2

* First CRAN release
* **Breaking change**: Moved global variables into a separate environment called `.misha`. Variables such as `ALLGENOME` can now be accessed as `.misha$ALLGENOME`. This change is not backwards compatible, please update your code accordingly.
* **Breaking change**: Repair names of the resulting data frame of `gintervals.neighbors` (same as `gintervals.neighbors1` from `misha.ext`). This means that instead of having two columns of 'chrom', 'start' and 'end', the resulting data frame would have 'chrom1', 'start1' and 'end1'.

# misha 1.00

*  Fix an error when the expression is too long or something like that (Rami for details) Fixed by Amos 5/7/10 patched .Rprofile
*  Fix gcreate crash
*  If I have track names with a minus sign in them - they are built correctly - but I can't do conditions on them. e.g. : rv <- gscreen (GSE14097.ERG_AR_re_ChIP-7 > 20 && TE.WT__Input < 7). Resolve but blocking - signs in track names (and maybe other sensitive characters). Fixed: track names are not allowed to contain characters other than alphanumeric and _. The fix applies for gcreatetrack, gcachemultires, gsmooth.
*  added support for writing multi resolution track binning (gcachemultires) - for use by tgbr.
*  Misha: grmtrack does not remove the dataset directory when the last track is deleted
*  Misha: add force delete command line option for grmtrack for track deletion without confirmation
*  Misha: add grmdataset function to delete the whole dataset recursively
*  Misha: eliminate use of the slow gsetroot() for track list refresh after track creation or removal The fix applies to grmtrack, gcreatetrack, gcachemultires, gsmooth.
*  Rami: On failure to create a track - remove it. The fix applies for gcreatetrack, gcachemultires, gsmooth.
*  Misha: allow a dot in the name of the track variable.
*  should store the command that created a track in a track variable (For future reference), we should also save the date (in the future we may want to do something with dependencies). Each newly created track is assigned two track variables: created.by and created.date.
*  Rami: Easier dump to text of info (current need to use sep="\t" rownames = F, etc) Added gwrite.table() function.
*  Summary statistics on tracks (a simplification of the distribution feature). We want to compute the total, average, stdev, min and max of a track, number of bins, number of NAN bins. All that without going through the distribution computation (maybe using R function that seat over the gdist function) New function added: gsummary.
*  Change coordinate->bin function (should be int(coordinate/bin_size)
*  Iterator protect/unprotect (eval_next_int, eval_next_bool etc)
*  Misha: gsetroot() should undefine previous track variables
*  Misha: mix of float and double in gdist() causes incorrect bin assignment for the values at the border.
*  Misha: add smart progress report.
*  Misha: end coordinate of the last segment of the chromosome was mistakenly extended by binsize.
*  Misha: limit the range that intervals cover for gextract and gquantiles to prevent memory allocation failures.
*  Misha: enhance gintervals() function to accept chroms as strings without "chr" prefix or as integers.
*  eliminate gpath support.
*  Allow various services (gscan, gdist) to be limited to a subset of the genome (defined by a give interval set). This will probably require changing the classes that iterate over chromosome such that all will use a common GenomeTrack interface.
*  Misha: allow track expressions for gextract and gquantiles.
*  Rami: Find out why you need to do 'as.vector' on output of gquantiles to get regular numbers. Misha: as designed. gquantiles returns a table, not a vector. The table is of NxM size where N is the number of intervals, and M is the number of quantiles.
*  Return intervals as a dataframe from C code rather than a list that should be later converted to a dataframe. Misha: affects gscreen, gwilcox, gintervals.union, gsetroot. Improves run time for large sets of intervals.
*  Misha: intervals returned by gwilcox should cover the whole area covered by the small window rather than just the center of the window.
*  Why is the usage of: PeakIntervals_TE_AR_AR <- gwilcox (TE.TE_AR_DHT__AR, 100000, 1000, maxpval = 0.001) - giving me intervals with peak values of 0? Misha: added _what2find_ option to gwilcox. This option controls whether peaks/lows or both should be searched by gwilcox.
*  Implement operations on intervals. Union: generate a new interval set, which include an interval for each closure of the two given set. Intersection: returns an interval set with all the non empty intersections of intervals in the two sets. Difference: returns the intervals of set A such that intersection with interval from B are removed. Misha: added gintervals.union(), gintervals.intersect(), gintervals.diff() function
*  Call R eval in bulks to boost run times. Misha: added ".bufsize=1" parameter to all functions that accept track expressions. Increase "bufsize" to boost the performance.
*  Misha: allow command interruption by "ctrl-C" in various function such as gwilcox. (Check R event loop?)
*  Misha: if "ctrl-C" is pressed whilst gcreate/gsmooth/gcachemult track directory is not removed.
*  Add gintervals.annotate function
*  Add auto-completion with TAB for annotations.
*  Add gls.annots() function
*  Add support for annotation function "annotation.dist" in the track expressions

*  Misha: fix error messages format Misha: fixed with an ugly hack
*  Add gapply
*  Allow TrackScanner to iterate over a few track expressions
*  Bug: message "Error: GBINSIZE variable is undefined or not numeric" is printed when invalid trackname is used in track expression.
*  Bug: invalid results whenever the same track is used in more than one track expression in gdist()
*  Bug: incorrect pvals when the limits are falling on the maximum
*  Bug: incorrect annot.dist when you also use intervals=something
*  Bug: gscreen returns one bin less for each interval
*  create all track dirs with group open permissions
*  Provide quick gsetroot (for scripts - e.g. not set up of completion variables? focus on subset of dirs? lazy init of gsetroot?) Misha: the performance of the original gsetroot was optimized
*  Take care of environment handling in various eval(parse()) constructs
*  Allow string parameters for track_expr - if the parameter is a string, just avoid parse
*  Reverse the convention of positive / negative distance between coord / interval and annotation
*  Change DB directory structure: tracks/tracksets/tracknames, annots/annotsets/annotnames Misha: renamed functions: gls => gls.tracks, gcreatetrack => gcreate.track, grmtrack => grm.track, grmdataset => grm.trackset. Newly added functions: gls.annots, gls.annotsets, gls.tracksets, gcreate.annotset, grm.annotset.
*  Add trackset / annotset manipulation functions + user / global flag support
*  Bug: if ~ symbol is used in gsetroot, track files cannot be accessed
*  Allow custom column names for gapply and gextract
*  Regression tests
*  make it easier to import intervals/annotations: add ginterval.import that will take non canonical intervals and will sort them and unify them to become disjoint. The function will return the canonical ginterval object plus a factor mapping ids in the original data frame to the new canonical gintervals. We can then use tapply to import meta-data.
*  Merge annotations and intervals concepts. Misha: renamed functions: gls.annots => gls.intervs, gls.annotset => gls.intervsets, grm.annots => grm.intervs, grm.annotsets => grm.intervsets. Newly added functions: gintervals.load, gintervals.save.
*  Effi: segmentation fault in gdist
*  Buf fix: calling gprepare_pvals() twice on the same track fails
*  need a simple way to merge data onto intervals, without reordering and invalidating the intervals (i.e. doing ginterval.import after merge is annoying. This may be solvable using standard r merge options, but we need to wrap it up nicely) Misha: Added gintervals.merge function
*  More protective use of intervals: coerce fields as factors if needed and generally be aware of potential user changes to intervals.
*  allow collection of pairs of interval within a maximal distance Misha: Added gintervals.neighbors function
*  Bug fix: gcachemultires does not work
*  Decide about the naming policy for the functions
*  Restrict gdist to accept minval=2
*  Add dist.XXX function
*  check how many times gapply calls func1 in gapply(func1(x1), track, gintervals(1, 0, 100))
*  gintervals.apply should reverse intervals of the minus strand
*  bug: gintervals.neighbors(gintervals(1, 0, 2000, 1), gintervals(1, 500, 1500, 1), 0, 0) produces an error
*  added colnames parameter to gintervals.neighbors
*  file descriptors are not closed properly in onexit() causing various *.create* functions to leave junk if interrupted
*  chromo sequence and pwms to the trackdb directory: allow import of pwms to the library (using several sets of pwm, each defined by a file?)
*  allow PWM energy computation (using the chromo sequence and a pwm)
*  Create tracks from 4c sites and prof files
*  BUG: The same interval.dist could not appear more than once in an expression - for example , gdist(global.tss.dist+global.tss.dist,-1000,1000,100) produces "object 'global.tss.dist' not found"
*  Provide the interval ID in the function provided to intervals.gapply Misha: GINTERVID variable is maintained while gapply
*  add progress report for non-track expression functions Misha: added progress report to gintervals.annotate
*  Allow to smooth NaN values in gtrack.smooth (add smooth_nans parameter)
*  it might be useful to have a direct way get sets of intervals corresponding to division of the genome according to the values of some track. it would be best if gdist could return another extra value with intervals corresponding to each of the track combinations Misha: gpartition function was added
*  Misha: avoid memory blow up when large vectors are returned by gquantile, etc.
*  gseq.extract() should return reverse-complementary sequence for strand -1
*  Bug fix: gpartition does not treat NaNs correctly
*  Change gdist and gpartition to accept breaks rather than minval/maxval/numbins
*  Bug: with equal bin size gdist crashes
*  Bug: gquantiles crashes with error: unprotect_ptr: pointer not found
*  Bug: gdist called from a function does not work Misha: deal with unevaluated (=promised) values
*  In case of track expression result mismatch save the result of the last evaluation in GERROR_EXPR variable
*  Bug: gtrack.make_pvals() does not work
*  Bug: gsummary() max value is incorrect for negative values
*  Added gvar.get() function
*  Added gvar.exists() function
*  gvar.rm() "warning: variable was not found" when variable exists but not loaded
*  Added gtrack.binsize()
*  Allow gintervals(chrom) which is equal to gintervals(chrom, 0, -1)
*  Effi: if x contains a line of NA's gintervals.import(x) causes segmentation fault
*  Misha: optimize gextract to present chroms as factors rather than strings
*  Misha: truncate long column names
*  Added glookup() and gtrack.lookup() functions
*  Renamed "origin" attribute of gintervals.import to "mapping"
*  Allow regression tests to be invoked by the matching string
*  Removed gvar.loadall() function
*  Added gtrack.modify() function
*  Misha: delete gvar.loadall() - as it might blow up the memory in large databases
*  Misha: gvar.* functions do not work when track variable X is loaded and passed unquoted
*  Misha: read-only functions refuse to work with a track that does not have write permissions
*  Allow overlaps all functions except gintervals.intersect, gintervals.diff, gintervals.union, dist.XXX
*  Renamed gquantiles to gintervals.quantiles
*  Renamed gintervals.import to gintervals.canonic
*  Added gintervals.summary()
*  Added gquantiles()
*  Bug: gvar.load does not work when the variable is given unquoted
*  Warning "is.na() applied to non-(list or vector) of type 'NULL'" when gscreen(is.na(track)) is called
*  Versioning and installation added
*  Calling gintervals.canonic(i) when i is a dataframe without any rows causes R to crash Misha: other functions (gintervals.union, ...) were fixed too
