\arguments{
  \item{track}{track name}
  \item{description}{a character string description}

  \item{binsize}{bin size of the newly created 'Dense' track or '0' for a 'Sparse' track}
  \item{defval}{default track value}
}
\details{
This function creates a track from WIG / BigWig / BedGraph / tab-delimited file.  One can learn about the format of the tab-delimited file by running 'gextract' function on a 1D track with a 'file' parameter set to the name of the file. Zipped files are supported (file name must have '.gz' or '.zip' suffix).

If 'binsize' is 0 the resulted track is created in 'Sparse' format. Otherwise the 'Dense' format is chosen with a bin size equal to 'binsize'. The values that were not defined in input file file are substituted by 'defval' value.

'description' is added as a track attribute.
