\description{
Creates a track from WIG / BigWig / BedGraph / BED / tab-delimited file
}
\details{
This function creates a track from WIG / BigWig / BedGraph / tab-delimited
file. Zipped files are supported (file name must have '.gz' or '.zip' suffix).

Tab-delimited files must start with a header line with the following column
names (tab-separated): 'chrom', 'start', 'end', and exactly one value column
name (e.g. 'value'). Each subsequent line provides a single interval:
- chrom: chromosome name (e.g. 'chr1')
- start: 0-based start coordinate (inclusive)
- end: 0-based end coordinate (exclusive)
- value: numeric value (floating point allowed); exactly one value column is supported

Columns must be separated by tabs. Coordinates must refer to chromosomes
existing in the current genome. Missing values can be specified as 'NaN'.

BED files (.bed/.bed.gz/.bed.zip) are also supported. If the BED 'score'
column (5th column) exists and is numeric, it is used as the interval value;
otherwise a constant value of 1 is used. For BED inputs, 'binsize' controls
the output type: if 'binsize' is 0 the track is 'Sparse'; otherwise the track
is 'Dense' with bin-averaged values based on overlaps with BED intervals (and
'defval' for regions not covered).

If 'binsize' is 0 the resulted track is created in 'Sparse' format.
Otherwise the 'Dense' format is chosen with a bin size equal to 'binsize'.
The values that were not defined in input file file are substituted by
'defval' value.

'description' is added as a track attribute.

When multiple databases are connected via \code{\link{gsetroot}}, the track
is created in the current working directory (.misha$GWD), which defaults to the
last connected database. Use \code{\link{gdir.cd}} with an absolute path to
change where new tracks are created.
