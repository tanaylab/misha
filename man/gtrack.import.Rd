\description{
Creates a track from WIG / BigWig / BedGraph / tab-delimited file
}
\details{
This function creates a track from WIG / BigWig / BedGraph / tab-delimited
file.  One can learn about the format of the tab-delimited file by running
'gextract' function on a 1D track with a 'file' parameter set to the name of
the file. Zipped files are supported (file name must have '.gz' or '.zip'
suffix).

If 'binsize' is 0 the resulted track is created in 'Sparse' format.
Otherwise the 'Dense' format is chosen with a bin size equal to 'binsize'.
The values that were not defined in input file file are substituted by
'defval' value.

'description' is added as a track attribute.
