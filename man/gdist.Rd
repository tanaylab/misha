Calculates distribution of track expressions' values over the given set of bins.

\usage{
gdist([expr, breaks]+, intervals = ALLGENOME,
      include.lowest = FALSE, iterator = NULL, band = NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{expr}{track expression}
  \item{breaks}{breaks that determine the bin}
  \item{intervals}{genomic scope for which the function is applied}
  \item{include.lowest}{if 'TRUE', the lowest value of the range determined by breaks is included}
  \item{iterator}{track expression iterator. If 'NULL' iterator is determined implicitly based on track expressions.}
  \item{band}{track expression band. If 'NULL' no band is used.}
}
\details{
This function calculates the distribution of values of the numeric track expressions over the given set of bins.

The range of bins is determined by 'breaks' argument. For example: 'breaks=c(x1, x2, x3, x4)' represents three different intervals (bins): (x1, x2], (x2, x3], (x3, x4].

If 'include.lowest' is 'TRUE' the the lowest value will be included in the first interval, i.e. in [x1, x2]

'gdist' can work with any number of dimensions. If more than one 'expr'-'breaks' pair is passed, the result is a multidimensional vector, and an individual value can be accessed by [i1,i2,...,iN] notation, where 'i1' is the first track and 'iN' is the last track expression.
}
\value{
N-dimensional vector where N is the number of 'expr'-'breaks' pairs.

## calculate the distribution of dense_track for bins:
## (0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.5] and (0.5, 1]
gdist("dense_track", c(0, 0.2, 0.5, 1))

## calculate two-dimensional distribution:
## dense_track vs. sparse_track
gdist("dense_track", seq(0, 1, by = 0.1), "sparse_track",
      seq(0, 2, by = 0.2), iterator = 100)
