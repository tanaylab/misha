\title{Applies a function to values of track expressions}
\usage{
gintervals.mapply(FUN = NULL, ..., intervals = NULL,
  enable.gapply.intervals = F, iterator = NULL, band = NULL,
  intervals.set.out = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{FUN}{function to apply, found via ‘match.fun’}

\item{intervals}{intervals for which track expressions are calculated}

\item{enable.gapply.intervals}{if 'TRUE', then a variable 'GAPPLY.INTERVALS'
is available}

\item{iterator}{track expression iterator. If 'NULL' iterator is determined
implicitly based on track expressions.}

\item{intervals.set.out}{intervals set name where the function result is
optionally outputed}

\item{expr}{track expressions whose values are used as arguments for 'FUN'}
}
\value{
If 'intervals.set.out' is 'NULL' a data frame representing intervals
with an additional column that contains the return values of 'FUN'.
}
\description{
Applies a function to values of track expressions for each interval.
}
\details{
This function evaluates track expressions for each interval from
'intervals'. The resulted vectors are passed then as arguments to 'FUN'.

If the intervals are one-dimensional and have an additional column named
'strand' whose value is '-1', the values of the track expression are placed
to the vector in reverse order.

The current interval index (1-based) is stored in 'GAPPLY.INTERVID' variable
that is available during the execution of 'gintervals.mapply'. There is no
guarantee about the order in which the intervals are processed. Do not rely
on any specific order and use 'GITERATOR.INTERVID' variable to detect the
current interval id.

If 'enable.gapply.intervals' is 'TRUE', an additional variable
'GAPPLY.INTERVALS' is defined during the execution of 'gintervals.mapply'.
This variable stores the current iterator intervals prior to track
expression evaluation. Please note that setting 'enable.gapply.intervals' to
'TRUE' might severely affect the run-time of the function.

Note: all the changes made in R environment by 'FUN' will be void if
multitasking mode is switched on. One should also refrain from performing
any other operations in 'FUN' that might be not "thread-safe" such as
updating files, etc. Please switch off multitasking ('options(gmultitasking
= FALSE)') if you wish to perform such operations.

If 'intervals.set.out' is not 'NULL' the result is saved as an intervals
set. Use this parameter if the result size exceeds the limits of the
physical memory.
