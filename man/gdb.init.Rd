\description{
Initializes connection with Genomic Database: loads the list of tracks,
intervals, etc.
}
\details{
'gdb.init' initializes the connection with the Genomic Database. It is
typically called first prior to any other function. When the package is
attached it internally calls to 'gdb.init.examples' which opens the
connection with the database located at 'PKGDIR/trackdb/test' directory,
where 'PKGDIR' is the directory where the package is installed.

The current working directory inside the Genomic Database is set to 'dir'.
If 'dir' is 'NULL', the current working directory is set to 'GROOT/tracks'.

If 'rescan' is 'TRUE', the list of tracks and intervals is achieved by
rescanning directory structure under the current current working directory.
Otherwise 'gdb.init' attempts to use the cached list that resides in
'groot/.db.cache' file.

Upon completion the connection is established with the database. If
auto-completion mode is switched on (see 'gset_input_method') the list of
tracks and intervals sets is loaded and added as variables to the global
environment allowing auto-completion of object names with <TAB> key. Also a
few global variables are defined. These variables should not be modified by
user.
