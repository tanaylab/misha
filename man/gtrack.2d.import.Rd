Creates a 2D track from tab-delimited file(s).
}
\details{
This function creates a 2D track track from one or more tab-delimited files.
Each file must start with a header desribing the columns. The first 6
columns must have the following names: 'chrom1', 'start1', 'end1', 'chrom2',
'start2', 'end2'. The last column is designated for the value and it may
have an arbitrary name. The header is followed by a list of intervals and a
value for each interval. Overlapping intervals are forbidden.

One can learn about the format of the tab-delimited file by running
'gextract' function on a 2D track with a 'file' parameter set to the name of
the file.

If all the imported intervals represent a point (i.e. end == start + 1) a
'Points' track is created otherwise it is a 'Rectangles' track.

'description' is added as a track attribute.

Note: temporary files are created in the directory of the track during the
run of the function. A few of them need to be kept simultaneously open. If
the number of chromosomes and / or intervals is particularly high, a few
thousands files might be needed to be opened simultaneously. Some operating
systems limit the number of open files per user, in which case the function
might fail with "Too many open files" or similar error. The workaround could
be:

1. Increase the limit of simultaneously opened files (the way varies
depending on your operating system). 2. Increase the value of
'gmax.data.size' option. Higher values of 'gmax.data.size' option will
increased memory usage of the function but create fewer temporary files.
