\arguments{
\item{intervals}{intervals from another assembly}

\item{chain}{name of chain file or data frame as returned by
'gintervals.load_chain'}

\item{src_overlap_policy}{policy for handling source overlaps: "error" (default), "keep", or "discard". "keep" allows one source interval to map to multiple target intervals, "discard" discards all source intervals that have overlaps and "error" throws an error if source overlaps are detected.}

\item{tgt_overlap_policy}{policy for handling target overlaps. One of:
\tabular{ll}{
  Policy \tab Description \cr
  error \tab Throws an error if any target overlaps are detected. \cr
  auto \tab Default. Alias for "auto_score". \cr
  auto_score \tab Resolves overlaps by segmenting the target region and selecting the best chain for each segment based on alignment score (highest score wins). Tie-breakers: longest span, then lowest chain_id. \cr
  auto_longer \tab Resolves overlaps by segmenting and selecting the chain with the longest span for each segment. Tie-breakers: highest score, then lowest chain_id. \cr
  auto_first \tab Resolves overlaps by segmenting and selecting the chain with the lowest chain_id for each segment. \cr
  keep \tab Preserves all overlapping intervals. \cr
  discard \tab Discards any chain interval that has a target overlap with another chain interval. \cr
  agg \tab Segments overlaps into smaller disjoint regions where each region contains all contributing chains, allowing downstream aggregation to process multiple values per region. \cr
  best_source_cluster \tab Best source cluster strategy based on source overlap. When multiple chains map a source interval, clusters them by source overlap: if chain source intervals overlap (indicating true duplications), all mappings are retained; if chain source intervals are disjoint (indicating conflicting/alternative mappings), only the cluster with the largest total target length is kept. \cr
}}

\item{min_score}{optional minimum alignment score threshold. Chains with scores below this value are filtered out. Useful for excluding low-quality alignments.}

\item{include_metadata}{logical; if TRUE, adds 'score' column to the output indicating the alignment score of the chain used for each mapping. Only applicable with "auto_score" or "auto" policy.}

\item{canonic}{logical; if TRUE, merges adjacent target intervals that originated from the same source interval (same intervalID) and same chain (same chain_id). This is useful when a source interval maps to multiple adjacent target blocks due to chain gaps.}
}
\value{
A data frame representing the converted intervals. For 1D intervals, always includes 'intervalID' (index of original interval) and 'chain_id' (identifier of the chain that produced the mapping) columns. The chain_id column is essential for distinguishing results when a source interval maps to multiple target regions via different chains (duplications). When include_metadata=TRUE, also includes 'score' column.
}
\description{
Converts intervals from another assembly to the current one.
}
\details{
This function converts 'intervals' from another assembly to the current one.
Chain file instructs how the conversion of coordinates should be done. It
can be either a name of a chain file or a data frame in the same format as
returned by 'gintervals.load_chain' function.

The converted intervals are returned. An additional column named
'intervalID' is added to the resulted data frame. For each interval in the
resulted intervals it indicates the index of the original interval.

Note: When passing a pre-loaded chain (data frame), overlap policies cannot
be specified - they are taken from the chain's attributes that were set
during loading. When passing a chain file path, policies can be specified
and will be used for loading.
