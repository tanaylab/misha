\title{Converts intervals from another assembly}
\usage{
gintervals.liftover(
  intervals = NULL,
  chain = NULL,
  src_overlap_policy = "error",
  tgt_overlap_policy = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{intervals}{intervals from another assembly}

\item{chain}{name of chain file or data frame as returned by
'gintervals.load_chain'}

\item{src_overlap_policy}{policy for handling source overlaps: "error" (default), "keep", or "discard". "keep" allows one source interval to map to multiple target intervals, "discard" discards all source intervals that have overlaps and "error" throws an error if source overlaps are detected.}

\item{tgt_overlap_policy}{policy for handling target overlaps: "error", "auto" (default), "auto_first", "auto_longer", "discard", or "keep". "auto"/"auto_first" keep the first overlapping chain (original file order) by trimming later overlaps while keeping source/target lengths in sync, "auto_longer" keeps the longer overlapping chain, "discard" removes overlapping target intervals, and "keep" preserves them (liftover must be able to handle overlaps).}
}
\value{
A data frame representing the converted intervals.
}
\description{
Converts intervals from another assembly to the current one.
}
\details{
This function converts 'intervals' from another assembly to the current one.
Chain file instructs how the conversion of coordinates should be done. It
can be either a name of a chain file or a data frame in the same format as
returned by 'gintervals.load_chain' function.

The converted intervals are returned. An additional column named
'intervalID' is added to the resulted data frame. For each interval in the
resulted intervals it indicates the index of the original interval.
