\title{Imports genes and annotations from files}
\usage{
gintervals.import_genes(genes.file = NULL, annots.file = NULL,
  annots.names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes.file}{name or URL of file that contains genes}

\item{annots.file}{name of URL file that contains annotations. If 'NULL' no
annotations are imported}

\item{annots.names}{annotations names}
}
\value{
A list of four intervals sets named 'tss', 'exons', 'utr3' and
'utr5'. 'strand' column and annotations are attached to the intevals.
}
\description{
Imports genes and annotations from files.
}
\details{
This function reads a definition of genes from 'genes.file' and returns four
sets of intervals: TSS, exons, 3utr and 5utr. In addition to the regular
intervals columns 'strand' column is added. It contains '1' values for '+'
strands and '-1' values for '-' strands.

If annotation file 'annots.file' is given then annotations are attached too
to the intervals. The names of the annotations as they would appear in the
return value must be specified in 'annots.names' argument.

Both 'genes.file' and 'annots.file' can be either a file path or URL in a
form of 'ftp://[address]/[file]'. Files that these arguments point to can be
zipped or unzipped.

Examples of 'genes.file' and 'annots.file' can be found here:

\code{ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/knownGene.txt.gz}
\code{ftp://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/kgXref.txt.gz}

If a few intervals overlap (for example: two TSS regions) they are all
unified to an interval that covers the whole overlapping region. 'strand'
value is set to '0' if two or more of the overlapping intervals have
different strands. The annotations of the overlapping intervals are
concatenated to a single character string separated by semicolons. Identical
values of overlapping intervals' annotation are eliminated.
