\title{Runs R commands on a cluster}
\usage{
gcluster.run(..., opt.flags = "", max.jobs = 400, debug = FALSE, R = "R")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{R commands}

\item{opt.flags}{optional flags for qsub command}

\item{max.jobs}{maximal number of simultaneously submitted jobs}

\item{debug}{if 'TRUE', additional reports are printed}

\item{R}{command that launches R}
}
\value{
Return value ('retv') is a list, such that 'retv[[i]]' represents
the result of the run of command number 'i'. Each result consists of 4
fields that can be accessed by 'retv[[i]]$FIELDNAME':

\tabular{ll}{ \emph{FIELDNAME} \tab \emph{DESCRIPTION}\cr exit.status \tab
Exit status of the command. Possible values: 'success', 'failure' or
'interrupted'.\cr retv \tab Return value of the command.\cr stdout \tab
Standard output of the command.\cr stderr \tab Standard error of the
command. }
}
\description{
Runs R commands on a cluster that supports SGE.
}
\details{
This function runs R commands on a cluster by distributing them among
cluster nodes. It must run on a machine that supports Sun Grid Engine (SGE).
The order in which the commands are executed can not be guaranteed,
therefore the commands must be inter-independent.

Optional flags to 'qsub' command can be passed through 'opt.flags'
parameter. Users are strongly recommended to use only '-l' flag as other
flags might interfere with those that are already used (-terse, -S, -o, -e,
-V). For additional information please refer to the manual of 'qsub'.

The maximal number of simultaneously submitted jobs is controlled by
'max.jobs'.

Set 'debug' argument to 'TRUE to allow additional report prints.

'gcluster.run' launches R on the cluster nodes to execute the commands. 'R'
argument specifies how R executable should be invoked.
