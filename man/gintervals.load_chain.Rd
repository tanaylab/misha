\title{Loads assembly conversion table from a chain file}
\usage{
gintervals.load_chain(
  file = NULL,
  src_overlap_policy = "error",
  tgt_overlap_policy = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{name of chain file}

\item{src_overlap_policy}{policy for handling source overlaps: "error" (default), "keep", or "discard"}

\item{tgt_overlap_policy}{policy for handling target overlaps: "error", "auto" (default), or "discard"}
}
\value{
A data frame representing assembly conversion table.
}
\description{
Loads assembly conversion table from a chain file.
}
\details{
This function reads a file in 'chain' format and returns assembly conversion
table that can be used in 'gtrack.liftover' and 'gintervals.liftover'.

Source overlaps occur when the same source genome position maps to multiple
target genome positions. Target overlaps occur when multiple source positions
map to overlapping regions in the target genome.

The 'src_overlap_policy' controls how source overlaps are handled:
\itemize{
  \item "error" (default): Throw an error if source overlaps are detected
  \item "keep": Keep all mappings, allowing one source to map to multiple targets
  \item "discard": Remove all chain intervals involved in source overlaps
}

The 'tgt_overlap_policy' controls how target overlaps are handled:
\itemize{
  \item "error": Throw an error if target overlaps are detected
  \item "auto" (default): Automatically resolve overlaps by truncating/splitting intervals
  \item "discard": Remove all chain intervals involved in target overlaps
}
