\description{
Creates a track from a file of inter-genomic contacts.
}
\details{
This function creates a 'Points' (two-dimensional) track from contacts
files. If 'allow.duplicates' is 'TRUE' duplicated contacts are allowed and
summed up, otherwise an error is reported.

Contacts (coord1, coord2) within the same chromosome are automatically
doubled to include also '(coord2, coord1)' unless 'coord1' equals to
'coord2'.

Contacts may come in one or more files.

If 'fends' is 'NULL' contacts file is expected to be in "intervals-value"
tab-separated format. The file starts with a header defining the column
names. The first 6 columns must have the following names: 'chrom1',
'start1', 'end1', 'chrom2', 'start2', 'end2'. The last column is designated
for the value and it may have an arbitrary name. The header is followed by a
list of intervals and a value for each interval. An interval of form
(chrom1, start1, end1, chrom2, start2, end2) is added as a point (X, Y) to
the resulted track where X = (start1 + end1) / 2 and Y = (start2 + end2) /
2.

One can see an example of "intervals-value" format by running 'gextract'
function on a 2D track with a 'file' parameter set to the name of the file.

If 'fends' is not 'NULL' contacts file is expected to be in "fends-value"
tab-separated format. It should start with a header containing at least 3
column names 'fend1', 'fend2' and 'count' in arbitrary order followed by
lines each defining a contact between two fragment ends.

\tabular{lll}{ COLUMN \tab VALUE \tab DESCRIPTION\cr fend1 \tab Integer \tab
ID of the first fragment end \cr fend2 \tab Integer \tab ID of the second
fragment end \cr count \tab Numeric \tab Value associated with the contact
\cr }

A fragment ends file is also in tab-separated format. It should start with a
header containing at least 3 column names 'fend', 'chr' and 'coord' in
arbitrary order followed by lines each defining a single fragment end.

\tabular{lll}{ COLUMN \tab VALUE \tab DESCRIPTION\cr fend \tab Unique
integer \tab ID of the fragment end \cr chr \tab Chromosome name \tab Can be
specified with or without "chr" prefix, like: "X" or "chrX" \cr coord \tab
Integer \tab Coordinate\cr }

'description' is added as a track attribute.

Note: temporary files are created in the directory of the track during the
run of the function. A few of them need to be kept simultaneously open. If
the number of chromosomes and / or contacts is particularly high, a few
thousands files might be needed to be opened simultaneously. Some operating
systems limit the number of open files per user, in which case the function
might fail with "Too many open files" or similar error. The workaround could
be:

1. Increase the limit of simultaneously opened files (the way varies
depending on your operating system). 2. Increase the value of
'gmax.data.size' option. Higher values of 'gmax.data.size' option will
increased memory usage of the function but create fewer temporary files.
