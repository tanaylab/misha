\usage{
gcanvas.train(
  ...,
  mask = NULL,
  intervals = NULL,
  iterator = NULL,
  pseudocount = 1,
  min_obs = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more dimension specifications. Each specification is a list
     containing:
\describe{
  \item{expr}{Track expression for this dimension (required)}
  \item{breaks}{Numeric vector of bin boundaries for this dimension (required)}
  \item{bin_merge}{Optional list of merge specifications for merging sparse bins.
        Each specification is a named list with 'from' and 'to' elements.}
}}

\item{mask}{Optional intervals to exclude from training. Regions in the mask
will not contribute to k-mer counts. Can be computed using \code{gscreen()}.}

\item{intervals}{Genomic intervals to process. If NULL, uses all chromosomes.}

\item{iterator}{Iterator for track evaluation, determines the resolution at which
track values are computed.}

\item{pseudocount}{Pseudocount added to all k-mer counts to avoid zero probabilities.
Default is 1.}

\item{min_obs}{Minimum number of observations (6-mers) required per bin. Bins with
fewer observations will be marked as NA (not learned) and a warning will be
issued. Default is 0 (no minimum). During sampling, NA bins will fall back
to uniform sampling unless merged via \code{bin_merge}.}
}
\value{
A \code{gcanvas.model} object containing:
  \describe{
    \item{n_dims}{Number of stratification dimensions}
    \item{dim_specs}{List of dimension specifications (expr, breaks, num_bins, bin_map)}
    \item{dim_sizes}{Vector of bin counts per dimension}
    \item{total_bins}{Total number of bins (product of dim_sizes)}
    \item{total_kmers}{Total number of valid 6-mers counted}
    \item{per_bin_kmers}{Number of 6-mers counted per bin}
    \item{total_masked}{Number of positions skipped due to mask}
    \item{total_n}{Number of positions skipped due to N bases}
    \item{model_data}{Internal model data (counts and CDFs)}
  }
}
\description{
Computes a 5th-order Markov model stratified by bins of one or more track
expressions (e.g., GC content and CG dinucleotide frequency). This model can
be used to generate synthetic genomes that preserve the k-mer statistics of
the original genome within each stratification bin.
