\title{Calculates summary statistics of a track expression for bins}
\usage{
gbins.summary(
  ...,
  expr = NULL,
  intervals = get("ALLGENOME"),
  include.lowest = FALSE,
  iterator = NULL,
  band = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{track expression for which summary statistics is calculated}

\item{intervals}{genomic scope for which the function is applied}

\item{include.lowest}{if 'TRUE', the lowest value of the range determined by
breaks is included}

\item{iterator}{track expression iterator. If 'NULL' iterator is determined
implicitly based on track expressions.}

\item{band}{track expression band. If 'NULL' no band is used.}

\item{bin_expr}{a track expression that determines the bin}

\item{breaks}{breaks that define the bins}
}
\value{
Multi-dimensional array representing summary statistics for each
bin.
}
\description{
Calculates summary statistics of a track expression for bins.
}
\details{
This function is a binned version of 'gsummary'. For each iterator interval
the value of 'bin_expr' is calculated and assigned to the corresponding bin
determined by 'breaks'. The summary statistics of 'expr' are calculated then
separatedly for each bin.

The bins can be multi-dimensional depending on the number of
'bin_expr'-'breaks' pairs.

The range of bins is determined by 'breaks' argument. For example:
'breaks=c(x1, x2, x3, x4)' represents three different intervals (bins): (x1,
x2], (x2, x3], (x3, x4].

If 'include.lowest' is 'TRUE' the the lowest value will be included in the
first interval, i.e. in [x1, x2].
