\arguments{
\item{track}{name of a created track}

\item{description}{a character string description}

\item{src.track.dir}{path to the directory of the source track}

\item{chain}{name of chain file or data frame as returned by
'gintervals.load_chain'}

\item{src_overlap_policy}{policy for handling source overlaps: "error" (default), "keep", or "discard". "keep" allows one source interval to map to multiple target intervals, "discard" discards all source intervals that have overlaps and "error" throws an error if source overlaps are detected.}

\item{tgt_overlap_policy}{policy for handling target overlaps. One of:
\tabular{ll}{
  Policy \tab Description \cr
  error \tab Throws an error if any target overlaps are detected. \cr
  auto \tab Default. Alias for "auto_score". \cr
  auto_score \tab Resolves overlaps by segmenting the target region and selecting the best chain for each segment based on alignment score (highest score wins). Tie-breakers: longest span, then lowest chain_id. \cr
  auto_longer \tab Resolves overlaps by segmenting and selecting the chain with the longest span for each segment. Tie-breakers: highest score, then lowest chain_id. \cr
  auto_first \tab Resolves overlaps by segmenting and selecting the chain with the lowest chain_id for each segment. \cr
  keep \tab Preserves all overlapping intervals. \cr
  discard \tab Discards any chain interval that has a target overlap with another chain interval. \cr
  agg \tab Segments overlaps into smaller disjoint regions where each region contains all contributing chains, allowing downstream aggregation to process multiple values per region. \cr
  best_source_cluster \tab Best source cluster strategy based on source overlap. When multiple chains map a source interval, clusters them by source overlap: if chain source intervals overlap (indicating true duplications), all mappings are retained; if chain source intervals are disjoint (indicating conflicting/alternative mappings), only the cluster with the largest total target length is kept. \cr
}}

\item{multi_target_agg}{aggregation/selection policy for contributors that land on the same target locus. When multiple source intervals map to overlapping regions in the target genome (after applying tgt_overlap_policy), their values must be combined into a single value.}

\item{params}{additional parameters for aggregation (e.g., for "nth" aggregation)}

\item{na.rm}{logical indicating whether NA values should be removed before aggregation (default: TRUE)}

\item{min_n}{minimum number of non-NA values required for aggregation. If fewer values are available, the result will be NA.}

\item{min_score}{optional minimum alignment score threshold. Chains with scores below this value are filtered out. Useful for excluding low-quality alignments.}

\value{
None.

\description{
Imports a track from another assembly.
}
\details{
This function imports a track located in 'src.track.dir' of another assembly
to the current database. Chain file instructs how the conversion of
coordinates should be done. It can be either a name of a chain file or a
data frame in the same format as returned by 'gintervals.load_chain'
function. The name of the newly created track is specified by 'track'
argument and 'description' is added as a track attribute.

Note: When passing a pre-loaded chain (data frame), overlap policies cannot
be specified - they are taken from the chain's attributes that were set
during loading. When passing a chain file path, policies can be specified
and will be used for loading. Aggregation parameters (multi_target_agg,
params, na.rm, min_n) can always be specified regardless of chain type.
