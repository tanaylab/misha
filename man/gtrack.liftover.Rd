\usage{
gtrack.liftover(
  track = NULL,
  description = NULL,
  src.track.dir = NULL,
  chain = NULL,
  src_overlap_policy = "error",
  tgt_overlap_policy = "error"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{track}{name of a created track}

\item{description}{a character string description}

\item{src.track.dir}{path to the directory of the source track}

\item{chain}{name of chain file or data frame with 8 columns as returned by
'gintervals.load_chain' (chrom, start, end, strand, chromsrc, startsrc, endsrc, strandsrc).
Strand columns use +1 for forward strand and -1 for reverse strand.}

\item{src_overlap_policy}{policy for handling source overlaps: "error" (default), "keep", or "discard". "keep" allows one source interval to map to multiple target intervals, "discard" discards all source intervals that have overlaps and "error" throws an error if source overlaps are detected.}

\item{tgt_overlap_policy}{policy for handling target overlaps: "error" (default), "auto" (default) or "discard". "auto" automatically resolves overlaps by truncating/splitting intervals, "discard" discards all target intervals that have overlaps and "error" throws an error if target overlaps are detected.}
}
\value{
None.

\description{
Imports a track from another assembly.
}
\details{
This function imports a track located in 'src.track.dir' of another assembly
to the current database. Chain file instructs how the conversion of
coordinates should be done. It can be either a name of a chain file or a
data frame in the same format as returned by 'gintervals.load_chain'
function. The name of the newly created track is specified by 'track'
argument and 'description' is added as a track attribute.

Source overlaps occur when the same source genome position maps to multiple
target genome positions. Using 'src_overlap_policy = "keep"' may result in
duplicated track values when one source position maps to multiple target
positions. Target overlaps occur when multiple source positions map to
overlapping regions in the target genome.

When passing a chain file path (as opposed to a pre-loaded chain data frame),
the policies are used both for loading the chain and performing the liftover.
When passing a pre-loaded chain data frame, the policies only apply to the
liftover operation itself.
}
\note{
Terminology note for UCSC chain format users: In the UCSC chain format specification,
the fields prefixed with 't' (tName, tStart, tEnd, etc.) are called "target" or "reference",
while fields prefixed with 'q' (qName, qStart, qEnd, etc.) are called "query". However,
misha uses reversed terminology: UCSC's "target/reference" corresponds to misha's "source"
(chromsrc, startsrc, endsrc), and UCSC's "query" corresponds to misha's "target"
(chrom, start, end).
