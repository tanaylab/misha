\arguments{
\item{track}{name of a created track}

\item{description}{a character string description}

\item{src.track.dir}{path to the directory of the source track}

\item{chain}{name of chain file or data frame as returned by
'gintervals.load_chain'}

\item{src_overlap_policy}{policy for handling source overlaps: "error" (default), "keep", or "discard". "keep" allows one source interval to map to multiple target intervals, "discard" discards all source intervals that have overlaps and "error" throws an error if source overlaps are detected.}

\item{tgt_overlap_policy}{policy for handling target overlaps: "error", "auto" (default), "auto_first", "auto_longer", "keep", or "discard". "auto"/"auto_first" keep the first overlapping chain (original file order) by trimming later overlaps, "auto_longer" keeps the longer overlapping chain, "keep" preserves overlaps, "discard" removes overlapping targets, and "error" throws an error if overlaps are detected.}

\item{multi_target_agg}{aggregation/selection policy for contributors that land on the same target locus. When multiple source intervals map to overlapping regions in the target genome (after applying tgt_overlap_policy), their values must be combined into a single value.}

\item{params}{additional parameters for aggregation (e.g., for "nth" aggregation)}

\item{na.rm}{logical indicating whether NA values should be removed before aggregation (default: TRUE)}

\item{min_n}{minimum number of non-NA values required for aggregation. If fewer values are available, the result will be NA.}
}
\value{
None.

\description{
Imports a track from another assembly.
}
\details{
This function imports a track located in 'src.track.dir' of another assembly
to the current database. Chain file instructs how the conversion of
coordinates should be done. It can be either a name of a chain file or a
data frame in the same format as returned by 'gintervals.load_chain'
function. The name of the newly created track is specified by 'track'
argument and 'description' is added as a track attribute.
